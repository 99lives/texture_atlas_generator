Texture atlas maker
This tool is used to convert timeline based animation into a spritesheet from an swf. it is very handy for creating texture atlas files that can be used with the sparrow framework

Steps:
Create a new fla and make sure it is minimum flash 9 using as3.
Start creating movieclips that you want to be written to a sprite sheet. Be sure to avoid using actionscript, and if you have sub clips use graphics as opposed to movieclips so that they get picked up.
Drag all the movieclips you want rendered to the main stage and name them.
Export the swf and load it into the tool.
Modify the size of the sprite sheet to fit your needs. Power of 2 textures are recommended:1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, etc..
Save the file. You will now have a zip containing your image a piece of xml and a piece of json you can use for your project.
